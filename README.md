### Background on this project

I discovered Hollow Knight about one month after its release through a series by youtuber Northernlion showcasing the game. I was skeptical at first, but drawn in by the size of the world, the range of music, and the tightness of its mechanics. I joined the [official discord server](http://discord.me/hollowknight) (though at the time it was just a budding community), played the game, and it was the first game I started speedrunning! During that time I was practicing Python, so I used discord.py to create my very first discord bot named **Zote, The Mighty**. He spoke his precepts in order, or you could specify a number to hear a specific one. Over time, I experimented with simple features like image reaction commands, channel and user permissions, and logging / error-reporting functions. Today he also provides resources like guides, spoiler alerts, and even hosted the 12 Days of Hollowmas Giveaway without major issues (no matter what pictures Verulean shows you).

Zote, like the in-game counterpart, is mediocre and self-assured, but with each commit gets closer to a functional open-source build. I'd like to continue developing this bot to help represent Team Cherry's amazing game to the Discord community, and contribute to Discord.py too.
